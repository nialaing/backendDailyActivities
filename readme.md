## Description

In this activity you will learn how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. 

This recipe is intended for children or those who are first-time PB&J builders.

These steps will create a standard list of steps to rely on to build a consistent peanut butter and jelly sandwich each time.


## User Story

As a child in the family, I want peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the picnic because I love them so much.


## Ingredients Used

The framework for this sandwich is:
- two pieces of white bread
- peanut butter 
- jelly

Other things you will need:
- two clean butter knives
- napkin(s)
- ziploc bag (lined with napkins to prevent "sweating")
- cutting board 

## Steps

1. Place two slices of your bread on a clean cutting board.

2. Start with your jelly slice. With a clean butter knife, dig into your jelly to get your desired amount of jelly.

3. Take your jellied knife and spread it over the slice. Lay that to the side (DO NOT PUT the jellied side down; put the dry side down!)

4. Next, take your second clean butter knife and dip it into the peanut butter to get your desired amount of peanut butter.

5. Spread your peanut butter knife onto your second slice of bread. 

6. Lay your peanut butter slice on top of the jelly slice. 

* If you want, cut it in half.

7. Eat it.
